    "I created several reference sequences of different sizes and generated perfect reads from these to use as test data. When trying to index a 1M long sequence with the first version of the code, my laptop crashed and indeed, the memory usage was higher than 128G. Using [memory profiler](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/memory_profiler) I identified one bottleneck in the `burrows_wheeler` method shown above. The list `all_permutations` will store a full length sequence for every position within the input sequence, which is obviously quadratic in memory. On top of this, the default sort method seemed slightly waistful of memory.\n",
